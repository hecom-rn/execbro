/**
 * Failure artifacts for `input_text`, on the same rails as `tap`'s.
 *
 * A targeting miss reaches telemetry as a 200-character string with the
 * candidate list already truncated out of it, which is enough to count the
 * failure and not nearly enough to say why it happened. The three cases behind
 * it — the field was never there, the screen moved under the agent, the matcher
 * was too strict (core/screenStaleness.ts) — are only separable with the screen
 * in front of you and the FULL candidate list beside the predicate that missed.
 *
 * Deliberately reuses tap's bundle shape, upload path and R2 endpoint rather
 * than growing a parallel one: the fields map cleanly (inputs are the
 * "pressables" this tool can reach), and a second endpoint would duplicate the
 * upload, retention and dashboard-modal code for no new capability.
